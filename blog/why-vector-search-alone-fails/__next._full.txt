# Why Vector Search Alone Fails Your AI Agent

Imagine you're building a healthcare AI agent. A patient asks: *"Can I eat shrimp tonight?"*

Your agent does what it's supposed to do - it embeds the question and runs a similarity search. Back come the results: shrimp recipes, nutritional info, some allergy FAQs. All genuinely relevant to the words "eat shrimp."

All completely wrong for this patient.

## What went wrong

The correct answer is "No, and it could be dangerous." But that answer doesn't live in any single document. It lives across three separate pieces of information:

```chain
Sarah takes Amiodarone
-- interacts with
Iodine
-- found in
Shrimp
=> Shrimp is risky for Sarah
```

The patient takes a specific medication. That medication interacts with iodine. Shrimp is high in iodine. Each fact sits in a different database. And the phrase "shrimp dinner" has zero similarity to "medication contraindications" - they share no words, no concepts, no embedding overlap.

This is the core problem: **the connection between these facts is logical, not semantic.** You can't find it by looking for similar text. You have to follow a chain of relationships from one fact to the next.

## This shows up everywhere

The healthcare example is vivid, but this same pattern appears in every domain where answers require connecting multiple facts.

```steps
A compliance analyst asks: "Is this transaction suspicious?" :: The vector DB finds similar transactions. It misses that Entity A is owned by Entity B, which is on a sanctions list.
An employee searches for Q3 revenue reports :: The vector DB returns 40 matches. It can't check whether this employee has permission to see any of them through the org hierarchy.
A supply chain manager asks about disruptions :: The vector DB finds news about port closures. It can't trace which of your suppliers use that port, and which products are affected.
```

In every case, the answer requires **following a chain of connected facts** - not finding a similar document. The information exists, but it's spread across different sources, and the connections between them are structural, not textual.

## Why more RAG tricks won't help

When teams hit this problem, the first instinct is to optimize the retrieval pipeline. Better chunking. Better embeddings. Hybrid search. Re-ranking.

None of these help, because the problem isn't retrieval quality. The retrieval is working perfectly - it's finding the most similar content. The problem is that similarity is the wrong tool for the job.

```flow
User question -> Embed -> Similarity search -> Similar documents
```

This pipeline answers: *"What text looks most like my question?"* That's great when the answer exists in a single document. It fails when the answer must be **derived** by connecting facts from different places.

## What teams end up building

To work around this, teams start adding systems. A graph database for relationships. A rules engine for business logic. An authorization service for access control. Application code to stitch it all together.

```flow
User question -> Vector DB [primary] -> Graph DB -> Rules engine -> Auth service -> Reconcile in app code
```

The reasoning logic ends up scattered across services. When a fact changes, you have to propagate the change across all of them. It works, but it's fragile, and each new capability makes it more fragile.

## What it looks like with a reasoning layer

InputLayer sits alongside your vector database and handles the part that similarity search can't: following chains of logic and deriving conclusions.

```flow
User question -> Your vector DB -> Similar documents
```

```flow
User question -> InputLayer [primary] -> Derived conclusions
```

You keep your vector database for what it's good at - finding similar content. You add InputLayer for questions that require reasoning: traversing relationships, evaluating rules, checking permissions through hierarchies.

When the patient's medication list changes, InputLayer automatically updates every downstream risk assessment. When an employee changes departments, their permissions recalculate through the org hierarchy. When a corporate ownership structure shifts, the compliance analysis adjusts. All of this happens incrementally - only the affected conclusions recompute, not the entire knowledge base.

## Getting started

InputLayer is open-source and runs in a single Docker container:

```bash
docker run -p 8080:8080 ghcr.io/inputlayer/inputlayer
```
