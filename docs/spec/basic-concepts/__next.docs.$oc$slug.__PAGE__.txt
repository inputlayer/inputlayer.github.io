This section explains the fundamental building blocks of InputLayer's query language.

## Relations (Tables)

A relation is a table that stores facts. Each relation has:
- A **name** (lowercase, like `edge` or `person`)
- A **schema** (the columns and their types)
- **Facts** (the rows)

```datalog
// Create a relation by inserting facts
+person("alice", 30)
+person("bob", 25)
```

This creates a `person` relation with 2 columns (name and age) and 2 rows.

## Facts (Rows)

A fact is a single row in a relation. Facts contain only values (no variables).

```datalog
// Insert facts
+edge(1, 2)           // edge has two integer columns
+user("alice", true)  // user has string and boolean columns
```

Facts are stored persistently. When you restart InputLayer, your facts are still there.

## Rules (Derived Tables)

Rules define new relations based on existing data. A rule has:
- A **head** (the relation being defined)
- A **body** (the conditions for deriving facts)

```datalog
// "path exists from X to Y if edge exists from X to Y"
+path(X, Y) <- edge(X, Y)

// "path exists from X to Z if path exists from X to Y and edge from Y to Z"
+path(X, Z) <- path(X, Y), edge(Y, Z)
```

The head is `path(X, Y)`. The body is everything after `<-`.

Rules don't store data directly - they compute results from stored facts. When facts change, rule results update automatically.

## Views

A view is a relation defined by rules. In the example above, `path` is a view.

Views are virtual tables:
- They don't store data directly
- Results are computed when queried
- Updates are incremental (only changed parts recompute)

## Queries

A query asks a question about your data. It returns matching facts.

```datalog
// Find all edges starting from node 1
?edge(1, X)

// Find all people older than 25
?person(Name, Age), Age > 25
```

Queries return results but don't modify any data.

## Variables

Variables start with an uppercase letter. They match any value.

| Pattern | Matches |
|---------|---------|
| `edge(X, Y)` | All edges (both columns bound to variables) |
| `edge(1, Y)` | Edges starting from node 1 |
| `edge(X, X)` | Self-loops (same value in both columns) |
| `edge(_, Y)` | All edges (ignore first column) |

The underscore `_` is a special variable that means "I don't care about this value."

## Constants

Constants are literal values:

| Type | Examples |
|------|----------|
| **Integer** | `1`, `-42`, `1000000` |
| **Float** | `3.14`, `-0.5`, `1e10` |
| **String** | `"hello"`, `"alice"`, `"with spaces"` |
| **Boolean** | `true`, `false` |
| **Vector** | `[1.0, 2.0, 3.0]` |

## Atoms (Predicate Calls)

An atom is a relation name with arguments:

```datalog
edge(1, 2)              // Atom with two constants
person(Name, Age)       // Atom with two variables
friend(X, "alice")      // Atom with variable and constant
```

In a rule body, atoms specify patterns to match. In a rule head, atoms specify what to produce.

## Schema (Column Types)

You can declare a relation's schema before inserting data:

```datalog
// Declare schema with types
+employee(id: int, name: string, salary: int)

// Now insert data
+employee(1, "alice", 50000)
+employee(2, "bob", 60000)
```

Schema declarations are optional. Without a schema, InputLayer accepts any value types (schema-less mode).

### Session vs Persistent Schemas

Like rules, schemas can be session or persistent:

```datalog
// Persistent schema - saved with knowledge graph
+user(id: int, email: string, name: string)

// Session schema - only for current connection
user(id: int, email: string, name: string)
```

## Program Structure

An InputLayer session consists of:

1. **Stored facts** - data in relations
2. **Persistent rules** - saved rule definitions
3. **Session rules** - temporary rules for this session
4. **Queries** - questions you ask

```datalog
// 1. Insert facts (stored)
+edge[(1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4)]

// 2. Define persistent rule (saved)
+path(X, Y) <- edge(X, Y)
+path(X, Z) <- path(X, Y), edge(Y, Z)

// 3. Define session rule (temporary)
long_path(X, Y) <- path(X, Y), X < Y

// 4. Query
?path(1, X)
```

## Knowledge Graphs

A knowledge graph is a named container for relations and rules. It's like a database in SQL systems.

```datalog
.kg create social        // Create a knowledge graph
.kg use social           // Switch to it
+follows(1, 2)           // Data goes in 'social'
.kg create work          // Create another
.kg use work             // Switch to it
+reports_to(1, 2)        // Data goes in 'work'
```

Each knowledge graph is isolated. Relations in `social` are separate from relations in `work`.0:{"buildId":"05bjYGyiAumoEMBrfWHih","rsc":["$","$1","c",{"children":[["$","$L2",null,{"page":{"title":"Core Concepts","content":"$3","toc":[{"level":2,"text":"Relations (Tables)","id":"relations-tables"},{"level":2,"text":"Facts (Rows)","id":"facts-rows"},{"level":2,"text":"Rules (Derived Tables)","id":"rules-derived-tables"},{"level":2,"text":"Views","id":"views"},{"level":2,"text":"Queries","id":"queries"},{"level":2,"text":"Variables","id":"variables"},{"level":2,"text":"Constants","id":"constants"},{"level":2,"text":"Atoms (Predicate Calls)","id":"atoms-predicate-calls"},{"level":2,"text":"Schema (Column Types)","id":"schema-column-types"},{"level":3,"text":"Session vs Persistent Schemas","id":"session-vs-persistent-schemas"},{"level":2,"text":"Program Structure","id":"program-structure"},{"level":2,"text":"Knowledge Graphs","id":"knowledge-graphs"}]},"slugKey":"spec/basic-concepts"}],null,"$L4"]}],"loading":null,"isPartial":false}
